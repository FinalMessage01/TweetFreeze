# TweetFreeze
Backup your Twitter account.

Have you ever wanted a snapshot of your Twitter account?
What if you are setting up another account but want all your tweets and friends
from your other account on the new one?

That's what TweetFreeze aims to do.
It aims to backup your account, and will automate the population of other accounts with that backup.
